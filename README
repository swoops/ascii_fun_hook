What is this?
============
This is a stupid hook I made just to learn more about how hooks work.  All it 
does is print the contents of ascii_img when you are booting up.  I put an ascii
art image of zoidberg in there myself.  I figured I would go ahead and put it in 
GIT so I could grab it easily.

I expect this only works on Arch, sorry guys.

Install
-------
sudo ./install.sh install

Uninstall
---------
sudo ./install.sh uninstall

Also
-----
Make sure to add the hook to your mkinitcpio.conf and run mkinitcpio -p linux
